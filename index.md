Are you looking for a fun event for software developers that combines entertainment and learning? 

We run Softwarewolves as an in-house one-day coding contest for your companies developers. This playful session engages you in competitive coding pitching your programming skills against your colleagues to achieve maximum business value.

Participants form teams to implement “bot players” for the well-known werewolves (AKA mafia) party game. The organizers define functionality for the bot players that they are prepared to 'pay' for. During public demos, teams can 'sell' their work to the organizers and heckle each others' solution.

About
---

This session was developed by Alexander Helleboogh, Johan Peeters and Nelis Bouck&eacute;.

Alexander plays the role of business customer. In daily life, he incarnates as a freelance software architect. During the nights, he invents juicy stories and maintains the .Net bot.

During the day, Johan pretends to be a freelance architect / security expert. At night, he shapeshifts into a softwarewolf maintaining the Game Engine and the Scala and nodejs bots. 

From dusk till dawn, nelis sinks his teeth into the softwarewolves datacenter and infrastructure and maintains the Java and Ruby bot. At dawn, he goes back to his role as a freelance architect.
