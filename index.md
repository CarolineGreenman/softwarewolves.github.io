###What?


Are you looking for a teambuilding event for software developers that combines entertainment and learning? Do you want something more entertaining than a training and more useful than canoeing?

We run Softwarewolves as an in-house coding contest for your companies' developers.
This playful session engages you in competitive coding pitching your programming skills against your colleagues to achieve maximum business value.

Participants typically form pairs and implement “bot players” for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)">well-known werewolves (AKA mafia) party game</a>.
They can earn credits by implementing requested functionality in 4 iterations.
This tests their market awareness, programming skills and development process.
During public demos, teams 'sell' their work and heckle competing solutions.
In the subsequent retrospective, participants come together to reflect on experiences and learn from each other.

###Session objectives

- Have fun while coding!
- Get to know your colleagues out of the office in a playful environment.
- Share programming practices and learn from each other.
- Learn to adapt your programming practices to achieve maximum value in a fast pace environment.
