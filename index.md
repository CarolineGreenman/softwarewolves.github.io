What?
---

Are you looking for a fun teambuilding event for software developers that combines entertainment and learning? Searching for something more fun then a training and more useful then going kayaking?

We run Softwarewolves as an in-house one-day / half a day coding contest for your companies developers. This playful session engages you in competitive coding pitching your programming skills against your colleagues to achieve maximum business value.

Participants form pairs to implement “bot players” for the [well-known werewolves (AKA mafia) party game](about.html). The organizers define functionality for the bot players that they are prepared to 'pay' for. Due to pairing, a participants technique is contrasted with the technique of the other person in the pair. During public demos, teams can 'sell' their work to the organizers and heckle each others' solution. During standups, participants share their experiences with the group and learn from each other.
