Are you looking for a fun event for software developers that combines entertainment and learning? 

We run Softwarewolves as an in-house one-day coding contest for your companies developers. This playful session engages you in competitive coding pitching your programming skills against your colleagues to achieve maximum business value.

Participants form teams to implement “bot players” for the well-known werewolves (AKA mafia) party game. The organizers define functionality for the bot players that they are prepared to 'pay' for. During public demos, teams can 'sell' their work to the organizers and heckle each others' solution.
