Softwarewolves is engaging one-day coding contest for developers that combines both entertainment and learning. Participants form teams to implement “bot players” for the well-known werewolves AKA mafia party game. The organizers define functionality for the bot players that they are prepared to 'pay' for. Teams can experiment with programming practices and technology choices in order to achieve maximum business value. As such, softwarewolves provides a cool platform where teams have fun coding, engage in a competition, and share experiences to learn from each other.
