What?

Are you looking for a fun teambuilding event for software developers that combines entertainment and learning? 

We run Softwarewolves as an in-house one-day coding contest for your companies developers. This playful session engages you in competitive coding pitching your programming skills against your colleagues to achieve maximum business value.

Participants form pairs to implement “bot players” for the well-known werewolves (AKA mafia) party game. The organizers define functionality for the bot players that they are prepared to 'pay' for. While pairing, participants cooperate and learn from each other. During public demos, teams can 'sell' their work to the organizers and heckle each others' solution. During standups, participants share their experiences with the group. 

Learning objectives
---

- Have fun while coding!
- Share experiences on programming practices and learn from others.
- Apply and adapt programming practices so that you achieve maximum value in simulated market conditions.

The softwarewolves coding contest aims to simulate real world conditions to provide a safe platform for experimenting with technology choices and development practices.

During a contest, we create a hypothetical market place for bots that play the well-known werewolves party game.
The session organizers have defined functionality for bots that they are prepared to 'pay' for.
If and when this functionality is demonstrated, the team that delivers it is awarded the published price.

Prerequisites
---

- Bring your computer
- A chat client that supports xmpp, such as Pidgin, Adium, etc.
- A development environment, preferably for Java, .Net, Ruby or Node.js as we provide a basic bot to start from in these technologies.
Prior knowledge of xmpp is not required!

Did you know our state-of-the-art game server is a raspberry pi that requires less energy in an hour than a jumbo jet in a millisecond?
