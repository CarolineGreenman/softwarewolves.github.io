The underlying technology used for the Softwarewolves game is the [Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP). Players are XMPP clients, and connect to an XMPP server. XMPP enables connecting players written in different languages and technologies.

But don't worry, you don't need XMPP knownledge to build a bot for softwarewolves. We provide basic bot implementations that encapsulate the XMPP-protocol so that you can start with minimal technical hurdles. Basic bots are available in the following programming languages:
- C#
- Java
- Ruby
- Node.js
- Scala

Other languages available at request.

Our state-of-the-art game server is a raspberry pi that runs ejabberd. Did you know that requires less energy in an hour than a jumbo jet in a millisecond?
