###Technology

The underlying technology used for the Softwarewolves game is the [Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP). Bot players are XMPP clients, and connect to an XMPP server running the game engine. XMPP enables connecting bot players written in different languages and technologies.

But don't worry, you don't need XMPP knownledge to build a bot for softwarewolves. We provide basic bot implementations that encapsulate the XMPP-protocol so that you can start with minimal technical hurdles. Basic bots are available in the following programming languages:
- C#
- Java
- Ruby
- Node.js
- Scala

Other languages available at request.
 
###Infastructure
Our state-of-the-art game server is a raspberry pi that runs ejabberd. Did you know that requires less energy in an hour than a jumbo jet in a millisecond?
