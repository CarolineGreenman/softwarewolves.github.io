About
=====

Softwarewolves is inspired by the party game [Werewolves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game) with roots in social psychology: 
- the werewolves game models a battle between an informed minority (the werewolves) and an uninformed majority (the townspeople). Players are secretly assigned roles: either werewolves, who know each other; or townspeople, who know only the number of werewolves amongst them. 
- In the game's night phase the werewolves covertly "murder" a townsperson. During the day phase, all of the surviving players debate the identities of the werewolves and vote to eliminate a suspect. Play continues until all of the werewolves have been eliminated, or until the werewolves outnumber the townspeople.
