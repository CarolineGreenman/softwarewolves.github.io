Werewolves (also known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)">Mafia</a>) is a party game with roots in social psychology: 
- The game is a battle between an informed minority (the werewolves) and an uninformed majority (the villagers). Players are secretly assigned roles: either werewolves, who know each other; or villagers, who know only the number of werewolves amongst them. 
- During the game's night phase the werewolves covertly "murder" a villagers. During the day, all of the surviving players debate the identities of the werewolves and vote to hang a suspect. Play continues until all of the werewolves have been eliminated, or until the werewolves outnumber the villagers.

Softwarewolves is a variant of this party game played in a chatroom, involving both human and bot players. The facilitators provide the infrastructure, a game engine and some basic bots to start from. As a participating team, your goal is to build a bot player that participates in the game. A product owner will publish stories for specific functionalities and their corresponding reward, such as
* voting according to specified patterns,
* playing the role of the werewolf,
* tracking the voting history of other players.

Teams can earn marks by successfully demoing one or several stories to the product owner.
