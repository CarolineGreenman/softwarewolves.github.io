Werewolves
==========

[Werewolves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game) is a party game modelling a battle between an informed minority (the werewolves) and an uninformed majority (the townspeople). Players are secretly assigned roles: either werewolves, who know each other; or townspeople, who know only the number of werewolves amongst them. In the game's night phase the werewolves covertly "murder" a townsperson. During the day phase, all of the surviving players debate the identities of the werewolves and vote to eliminate a suspect. Play continues until all of the werewolves have been eliminated, or until the werewolves outnumber the townspeople. 

Softwarewolves
==============
We consider a simplified version of the werewolves game in which there is only one werewolf.

The game follows a night and day cycle. 
* At night, the werewolf picks a villager to kill, while everyone else "sleeps". 
* During the day, the villagers wake up and discover that one of them has died, so they will discuss who might be the werewolf. The villagers lynch their guess, hoping it's the wolf. The villagers win if they kill the werewolf; the werewolf wins if there is only one villager left.

The following roles can be distinguished:
* Villager – The villager is the simplest role. In the daytime, you vote on who to kill. You try to narrow down who the wolf is. 
* Werewolf – The wolf kills one of the villagers during the night. During the day, the werewolf acts a villager trying to avoid suspicion.
