Softwarewolves is a session by Alexander Helleboogh, Johan Peeters and Nelis Bouck&eacute;.
- [Alexander](http://be.linkedin.com/in/alexanderhelleboogh) is a partner at [ArchiWise](http://www.archiwise.com) and freelance software architect. During the nights, he dreams about "killer" features and brews juicy stories for participants to implement. He maintains the C# bot to compensate for the fact he doesn't own a Windows computer.
- [Johan's](http://be.linkedin.com/in/johanpeeters) day job is [freelance software architect and software security expert](http://johanpeeters.com). At night, he shapeshifts into a softwarewolf maintaining the ultrastable Game Engine and has a weakness for bots in exotic programming languages such as Scala and Node.js.
- From dusk till dawn, [Nelis](http://www.linkedin.com/in/nelis) sinks his teeth into the [softwarewolves infrastructure](game.html) and maintains the Java and Ruby bot. At dawn, he goes back to his role as partner and freelance software architect at [ArchiWise](http://www.archiwise.com).
